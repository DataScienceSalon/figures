# R code

R code for figures and analyses in the slides of Coursera Statistics
with R specialization.

Currently this repository only contains code and figures from Course 4 - Bayesian Statistics. If further code is requested, please file an issue here, or comment on the course discussion forums.

Note that not all videos are listed among the folders. R code for
videos where there are figures and output in the slides generated in
R, and where the faculty teaching the course decided that would be
useful for learners to view the code are shared in this repository. If
further code is requested, please file an issue here, or comment on
the course discussion forums.
